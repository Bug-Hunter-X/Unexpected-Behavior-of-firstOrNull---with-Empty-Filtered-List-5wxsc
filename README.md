This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to Kotlin's `firstOrNull()` function when used with a potentially empty filtered list. The bug arises from an assumption that `firstOrNull()` always returns null when the collection is empty, but it does not always throw an exception when used after filtering even if the filtered list is empty. The solution shows how to handle this scenario using the elvis operator to provide a default value in case of an empty list.
